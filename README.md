# KITTY-BOT

Four leged animal robot.

# Abstract:

The aim of the project is to make a four leged robot which mimics the locomotion of the animal. It can walk easily on such terrains where,
wheeled bots may get some difficulties due to roughed surface.

# Acknowledgement:

We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our mentors Aman Singh (ME 3rd year), Pankaj Singh (ECE 3rd year)
and Jashan (BT 4th year) as well as our guide and senior mentor Shivam Shrivastava (EE 4th year & secretary, Models and 
Robotics Section) who gave us the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic “Kitty Bot” which helped us in 
doing a lot of research and we came to know about so many new things. Special Thanks to him for his exemplary guidance, monitoring and 
constant encouragement throughout the Project. I would also like to thank all mentors as they helped us a lot in finishing this project
within the limited time although being too busy for the Robocon 2018 project.


# Pre-Requisites:
  * Arduino Nano
  * 8 x Servo-motors
  * Jumper wires
  * Voltage Regulators
  * 4 x 5 Volt Regulator
  * Breadboard
  * 1 x 7.4 1200 mah LiPo Battery
  * 3D printed parts (optional)
  
# Work:

The bot consits of 4 servo motors mounted on 3D printed base as a leg joints. and 1 servo for for each leg.
the movement of leg controlled by 2 sevos. and all servos are synced by using microcontroller Arduino nano.


# Future improvements:
  * Add sensors for feedback.
  * The bot will be made more compact and lighter.
  * Use Deep learning to improve mutual movement of legs.
  * Use Pneumatic in knee joints to carry more load.
